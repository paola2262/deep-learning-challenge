## Challenge 21
## Project Title: Predicting Loan Status Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether loans are healthy (0) or high-risk (1) using machine learning. The dataset includes financial and demographic details about borrowers and their loan applications. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts loan status, helping financial institutions reduce risk and make better lending decisions.

## Installation
For this project, I needed to install the following:
* pip install tensorflow

## Dataset
* EIN: Employer Identification Number (removed during preprocessing)
* NAME: Name of the organization (removed during preprocessing)
* Additional demographic and financial features.
* APPLICATION_TYPE: Type of loan application
* CLASSIFICATION: Classification of the borrower
* ASK_AMT: Amount requested in the loan application
* IS_SUCCESSFUL: Target variable indicating loan status (1 for successful/healthy, 0 for unsuccessful/high-risk)
